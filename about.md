I am a developer with a passion for coding and a desire to continuously improve.

### Zaradai

I decide to pick the moniker *Zaridai* so that it would incorporate the most important part of my life, family (although I am quite sure there would say that
programming comes a very close second!!).

* **Zar**inah - My wonderful and understanding wife.
* **Ad**am
* **Ai**shah

I also needed to pick a programming moniker because Stephen Hough has become so common and I have been too slow to grab the available account names.
